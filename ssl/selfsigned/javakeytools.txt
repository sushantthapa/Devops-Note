To generate self signed SSL Certificate and add to JAVA truststore for using with Tomcat

keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -keystore selfsigned.jks -validity 365 -keysize 2048


keytool -list -v -keystore selfsigned.jks

keytool -export -keystore selfsigned.jks -storepass <password> -alias tomcat -file selfsigned.cer



keytool -printcert -v -file selfsigned.cer





keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -noprompt -alias tomcat -dname "CN=localhost, OU=NA, O=NA, L=NA, S=NA, C=NA" -keystore keystore.jks -validity 9999 -storepass changeme -keypass changeme




//add this to the server.xml

<Connector port="443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
          maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
          keystoreFile="/etc/ssl/self-signed/selfsigned.jks" keystorePass="changeit"
          clientAuth="false" acceptCount="100"/>





//DigiCert  JAVA TOOL KEY


//Important: You must install the SSL/TLS Certificate file to the same keystore and under the same alias name (e.g., "-alias server") that you used to generate your CSR. 
//If you try to install the certificate to a different keystore or under a different alias, the import command will not work.


//run the command below to import the certificate into your keystore

STEP 1:

*******keytool -genkey -alias server -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore your_site_name.jks



//your_site_name should be the name of the domain you want to secure with this SSL/TLS certificate. 
//When ordering a Wildcard certificate, do not include the asterisk (*) in the filename (e.g., your_site_name). 
//The asterisk is not a valid keytool character.


Important: When prompted for the first and last name, DO NOT type your first and last name. 
Instead, type the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for the site you are securing with this certificate (e.g., www.yourdomain.com, mail.yourdomain.com). 
Are you are ordering a Wildcard Certificate? Then your FQDN must begin with an asterisk (*). (e.g.,*.yourdomain.com).


STEP 2: 

//GENERATE A CSR FROM  YOUR NEW KEYSTORE


*******keytool -certreq -alias server -file csr.txt -keystore your_site_name.jks


//In the command above, your_site_name should be the name of the keystore file you created in 
Step 1: Use Keytool to Create a New Keystore or when using the DigiCert Java Keytool CSR Wizard.


//We recommend that you create a back-up copy of your Keystore file (your_site_domain.jks) before continuing. 
Having a back-up of the Keystore file can help resolve issues that may occur during certificate SSL/TLS installation.

STEP 3:

Open the .csr file you created with a text editor.

Copy the text, including the -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- and -----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- tags, and paste it in to the DigiCert order form.


STEP 4:

Important: You must install the SSL/TLS Certificate file to the same keystore and under the same alias name (e.g., "-alias server") that you used to generate your CSR. 
If you try to install the certificate to a different keystore or under a different alias, the import command will not work.



********keytool -import -alias server -file your_site_name.p7b -keystore your_site_name.jks

           acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true"
